For this project, we were given problems that we had to solve and then create a visual for our solutions. Ellee and I worked on this together, which was a struggle in itself as we were not on the same page of productiveness. This project involved a lot of variables to control the different sequences as well as the different colors in the sequences. Each solution had its own function. Arrays were also a key part of the code in order to have the same actions occur to multiple variables.
